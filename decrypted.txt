THEN LET NOT WINTER'S RAGGED HAND DEFACE, 
IN THEE THY SUMMER ERE THOU BE DISTILLED: 
MAKE SWEET SOME VIAL; TREASURE THOU SOME PLACE, 
WITH BEAUTY'S TREASURE ERE IT BE SELF-KILLED: 
THAT USE IS NOT FORBIDDEN USURY, 
WHICH HAPPIES THOSE THAT PAY THE WILLING LOAN; 
THAT'S FOR THY SELF TO BREED ANOTHER THEE, 
OR TEN TIMES HAPPIER BE IT TEN FOR ONE, 
TEN TIMES THY SELF WERE HAPPIER THAN THOU ART, 
IF TEN OF THINE TEN TIMES REFIGURED THEE: 
THEN WHAT COULD DEATH DO IF THOU SHOULDST DEPART, 
LEAVING THEE LIVING IN POSTERITY? 
BE NOT SELF-WILLED FOR THOU ART MUCH TOO FAIR, 
TO BE DEATH'S CONQUEST AND MAKE WORMS THINE HEIR. 
WHO WILL BELIEVE MY VERSE IN TIME TO COME 
IF IT WERE FILLED WITH YOUR MOST HIGH DESERTS? 
THOUGH YET HEAVEN KNOWS IT IS BUT AS A TOMB 
WHICH HIDES YOUR LIFE, AND SHOWS NOT HALF YOUR PARTS: 
IF I COULD WRITE THE BEAUTY OF YOUR EYES, 
AND IN FRESH NUMBERS NUMBER ALL YOUR GRACES, 
THE AGE TO COME WOULD SAY THIS POET LIES, 
SUCH HEAVENLY TOUCHES NE'ER TOUCHED EARTHLY FACES. 
SO SHOULD MY PAPERS (YELLOWED WITH THEIR AGE) 
BE SCORNED, LIKE OLD MEN OF LESS TRUTH THAN TONGUE, 
AND YOUR TRUE RIGHTS BE TERMED A POET'S RAGE, 
AND STRETCHED METRE OF AN ANTIQUE SONG. 
BUT WERE SOME CHILD OF YOURS ALIVE THAT TIME, 
YOU SHOULD LIVE TWICE IN IT, AND IN MY RHYME. 


SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY? 
THOU ART MORE LOVELY AND MORE TEMPERATE: 
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY, 
AND SUMMER'S LEASE HATH ALL TOO SHORT A DATE: 
SOMETIME TOO HOT THE EYE OF HEAVEN SHINES, 
AND OFTEN IS HIS GOLD COMPLEXION DIMMED, 
AND EVERY FAIR FROM FAIR SOMETIME DECLINES, 
BY CHANCE, OR NATURE'S CHANGING COURSE UNTRIMMED: 
BUT THY ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE, 
NOR LOSE POSSESSION OF THAT FAIR THOU OW'ST, 
NOR SHALL DEATH BRAG THOU WAND'REST IN HIS SHADE, 
WHEN IN ETERNAL LINES TO TIME THOU GROW'ST, 
SO LONG AS MEN CAN BREATHE OR EYES CAN SEE, 
SO LONG LIVES THIS, AND THIS GIVES LIFE TO THEE. 


DEVOURING TIME BLUNT THOU THE LION'S PAWS, 
AND MAKE THE EARTH DEVOUR HER OWN SWEET BROOD, 
PLUCK THE KEEN TEETH FROM THE FIERCE TIGER'S JAWS, 
AND BURN THE LONG-LIVED PHOENIX, IN HER BLOOD, 
MAKE GLAD AND SORRY SEASONS AS THOU FLEET'ST, 
AND DO WHATE'ER THOU WILT SWIFT-FOOTED TIME 
TO THE WIDE WORLD AND ALL HER FADING SWEETS: 
BUT I FORBID THEE ONE MOST HEINOUS CRIME, 
O CARVE NOT WITH THY HOURS MY LOVE'S FAIR BROW, 
NOR DRAW NO LINES THERE WITH THINE ANTIQUE PEN, 
HIM IN THY COURSE UNTAINTED DO ALLOW, 
FOR BEAUTY'S PATTERN TO SUCCEEDING MEN. 
YET DO THY WORST OLD TIME: DESPITE THY WRONG, 
MY LOVE SHALL IN MY VERSE EVER LIVE YOUNG.

AND AS I TRULY FIGHT, DEFEND ME HEAVEN!

SPEAK LIKE A TRUE KNIGHT, SO DEFEND THEE HEAVEN! 
BOLINGBROKE. HARRY OF HEREFORD, LANCASTER, AND DERBY, 
AM I; WHO READY HERE DO STAND IN ARMS 
TO PROVE, BY GOD'S GRACE AND MY BODY'S VALOUR, 
IN LISTS ON THOMAS MOWBRAY, DUKE OF NORFOLK, 
THAT HE IS A TRAITOR, FOUL AND DANGEROUS, 
TO GOD OF HEAVEN, KING RICHARD, AND TO ME. 
AND AS I TRULY FIGHT, DEFEND ME HEAVEN! 
MARSHAL. ON PAIN OF DEATH, NO PERSON BE SO BOLD 
OR DARING-HARDY AS TO TOUCH THE LISTS, 
EXCEPT THE MARSHAL AND SUCH OFFICERS 
APPOINTED TO DIRECT THESE FAIR DESIGNS. 
BOLINGBROKE. LORD MARSHAL, LET ME KISS MY SOVEREIGN'S HAND, 
AND BOW MY KNEE BEFORE HIS MAJESTY;

THAT VOW A LONG AND WEARY PILGRIMAGE. 
THEN LET US TAKE A CEREMONIOUS LEAVE 
AND LOVING FAREWELL OF OUR SEVERAL FRIENDS. 
MARSHAL. THE APPELLANT IN ALL DUTY GREETS YOUR HIGHNESS, 
AND CRAVES TO KISS YOUR HAND AND TAKE HIS LEAVE. 
KING RICHARD. WE WILL DESCEND AND FOLD HIM IN OUR ARMS. 
COUSIN OF HEREFORD, AS THY CAUSE IS RIGHT, 
SO BE THY FORTUNE IN THIS ROYAL FIGHT! 
FAREWELL, MY BLOOD; WHICH IF TO-DAY THOU SHED, 
LAMENT WE MAY, BUT NOT REVENGE THEE DEAD. 
BOLINGBROKE. O, LET NO NOBLE EYE PROFANE A TEAR 
FOR ME, IF I BE GOR'D WITH MOWBRAY'S SPEAR. 
AS CONFIDENT AS IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT 
AGAINST A BIRD, DO I WITH MOWBRAY FIGHT. 
MY LOVING LORD, I TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU; 
OF YOU, MY NOBLE COUSIN, LORD AUMERLE; 
NOT SICK, ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO DO WITH DEATH, 
BUT LUSTY, YOUNG, AND CHEERLY DRAWING BREATH. 
LO, AS AT ENGLISH FEASTS, SO I REGREET 
THE DAINTIEST LAST, TO MAKE THE END MOST SWEET. 
O THOU, THE EARTHLY AUTHOR OF MY BLOOD, 
WHOSE YOUTHFUL SPIRIT, IN ME REGENERATE, 
DOTH WITH A TWOFOLD VIGOUR LIFT ME UP 
TO REACH AT VICTORY ABOVE MY HEAD, 
ADD PROOF UNTO MINE ARMOUR WITH THY PRAYERS, 
AND WITH THY BLESSINGS STEEL MY LANCE'S POINT, 
THAT IT MAY ENTER MOWBRAY'S WAXEN COAT 
AND FURBISH NEW THE NAME OF JOHN O' GAUNT, 
EVEN IN THE LUSTY HAVIOUR OF HIS SON. 
GAUNT. GOD IN THY GOOD CAUSE MAKE THEE PROSPEROUS! 
BE SWIFT LIKE LIGHTNING IN THE EXECUTION, 
AND LET THY BLOWS, DOUBLY REDOUBLED, 
FALL LIKE AMAZING THUNDER ON THE CASQUE 
OF THY ADVERSE PERNICIOUS ENEMY. 
ROUSE UP THY YOUTHFUL BLOOD, BE VALIANT, AND LIVE. 
BOLINGBROKE. MINE INNOCENCE AND SAINT GEORGE TO THRIVE! 
MOWBRAY. HOWEVER GOD OR FORTUNE CAST MY LOT, 
THERE LIVES OR DIES, TRUE TO KING RICHARD'S THRONE, 
A LOYAL, JUST, AND UPRIGHT GENTLEMAN. 
NEVER DID CAPTIVE WITH A FREER HEART 
CAST OFF HIS CHAINS OF BONDAGE, AND EMBRACE 
HIS GOLDEN UNCONTROLL'D ENFRANCHISEMENT, 
MORE THAN MY DANCING SOUL DOTH CELEBRATE 
THIS FEAST OF BATTLE WITH MINE ADVERSARY. 
MOST MIGHTY LIEGE, AND MY COMPANION PEERS, 
TAKE FROM MY MOUTH THE WISH OF HAPPY YEARS. 
AS GENTLE AND AS JOCUND AS TO JEST 
GO I TO FIGHT: TRUTH HATH A QUIET BREAST. 
KING RICHARD. FAREWELL, MY LORD, SECURELY I ESPY 
VIRTUE WITH VALOUR COUCHED IN THINE EYE. 
ORDER THE TRIAL, MARSHAL, AND BEGIN. 
MARSHAL. HARRY OF HEREFORD, LANCASTER, AND DERBY, 
RECEIVE THY LANCE; AND GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT! 
BOLINGBROKE. STRONG AS A TOWER IN HOPE, I CRY AMEN. 
MARSHAL. [TO AN OFFICER] GO BEAR THIS LANCE TO THOMAS, 
DUKE OF NORFOLK. 
FIRST HERALD. HARRY OF HEREFORD, LANCASTER, AND DERBY, 
STANDS HERE FOR GOD, HIS SOVEREIGN, AND HIMSELF, 
ON PAIN TO BE FOUND FALSE AND RECREANT, 
TO PROVE THE DUKE OF NORFOLK, THOMAS MOWBRAY, 
A TRAITOR TO HIS GOD, HIS KING, AND HIM; 
AND DARES HIM TO SET FORWARD TO THE FIGHT. 
SECOND HERALD. HERE STANDETH THOMAS MOWBRAY, DUKE OF NORFOLK, 
ON PAIN TO BE FOUND FALSE AND RECREANT, 
BOTH TO DEFEND HIMSELF, AND TO APPROVE 
HENRY OF HEREFORD, LANCASTER, AND DERBY, 
TO GOD, HIS SOVEREIGN, AND TO HIM DISLOYAL, 
COURAGEOUSLY AND WITH A FREE DESIRE 
ATTENDING BUT THE SIGNAL TO BEGIN. 
MARSHAL. SOUND TRUMPETS; AND SET FORWARD, COMBATANTS. 
[A CHARGE SOUNDED] 
STAY, THE KING HATH THROWN HIS WARDER DOWN. 
KING RICHARD. LET THEM LAY BY THEIR HELMETS AND THEIR SPEARS, 
AND BOTH RETURN BACK TO THEIR CHAIRS AGAIN. 
WITHDRAW WITH US; AND LET THE TRUMPETS SOUND 
WHILE WE RETURN THESE DUKES WHAT WE DECREE. 

A LONG FLOURISH, WHILE THE KING CONSULTS HIS COUNCIL 

DRAW NEAR, 
AND LIST WHAT WITH OUR COUNCIL WE HAVE DONE. 
FOR THAT OUR KINGDOM'S EARTH SHOULD NOT BE SOIL'D 
WITH THAT DEAR BLOOD WHICH IT HATH FOSTERED; 
AND FOR OUR EYES DO HATE THE DIRE ASPECT 
OF CIVIL WOUNDS PLOUGH'D UP WITH NEIGHBOURS' SWORD; 
AND FOR WE THINK THE EAGLE-WINGED PRIDE 
OF SKY-ASPIRING AND AMBITIOUS THOUGHTS, 
WITH RIVAL-HATING ENVY, SET ON YOU 
TO WAKE OUR PEACE, WHICH IN OUR COUNTRY'S CRADLE 
DRAWS THE SWEET INFANT BREATH OF GENTLE SLEEP; 
WHICH SO ROUS'D UP WITH BOIST'ROUS UNTUN'D DRUMS, 
WITH HARSH-RESOUNDING TRUMPETS' DREADFUL BRAY, 
AND GRATING SHOCK OF WRATHFUL IRON ARMS, 
MIGHT FROM OUR QUIET CONFINES FRIGHT FAIR PEACE 
AND MAKE US WADE EVEN IN OUR KINDRED'S BLOOD- 
THEREFORE WE BANISH YOU OUR TERRITORIES. 
YOU, COUSIN HEREFORD, UPON PAIN OF LIFE, 
TILL TWICE FIVE SUMMERS HAVE ENRICH'D OUR FIELDS 
SHALL NOT REGREET OUR FAIR DOMINIONS, 
BUT TREAD THE STRANGER PATHS OF BANISHMENT. 
BOLINGBROKE. YOUR WILL BE DONE. THIS MUST MY COMFORT BE- 
THAT SUN THAT WARMS YOU HERE SHALL SHINE ON ME, 
AND THOSE HIS GOLDEN BEAMS TO YOU HERE LENT 
SHALL POINT ON ME AND GILD MY BANISHMENT. 
KING RICHARD. NORFOLK, FOR THEE REMAINS A HEAVIER DOOM, 
WHICH I WITH SOME UNWILLINGNESS PRONOUNCE: 
THE SLY SLOW HOURS SHALL NOT DETERMINATE 
THE DATELESS LIMIT OF THY DEAR EXILE; 
THE HOPELESS WORD OF 'NEVER TO RETURN' 
BREATHE I AGAINST THEE, UPON PAIN OF LIFE. 
MOWBRAY. A HEAVY SENTENCE, MY MOST SOVEREIGN LIEGE, 
AND ALL UNLOOK'D FOR FROM YOUR HIGHNESS' MOUTH. 
A DEARER MERIT, NOT SO DEEP A MAIM 
AS TO BE CAST FORTH IN THE COMMON AIR, 
HAVE I DESERVED AT YOUR HIGHNESS' HANDS. 
THE LANGUAGE I HAVE LEARNT THESE FORTY YEARS, 
MY NATIVE ENGLISH, NOW I MUST FORGO; 
AND NOW MY TONGUE'S USE IS TO ME NO MORE 
THAN AN UNSTRINGED VIOL OR A HARP; 
OR LIKE A CUNNING INSTRUMENT CAS'D UP 
OR, BEING OPEN, PUT INTO HIS HANDS 
THAT KNOWS NO TOUCH TO TUNE THE HARMONY. 
WITHIN MY MOUTH YOU HAVE ENGAOL'D MY TONGUE, 
DOUBLY PORTCULLIS'D WITH MY TEETH AND LIPS; 
AND DULL, UNFEELING, BARREN IGNORANCE 
IS MADE MY GAOLER TO ATTEND ON ME. 
I AM TOO OLD TO FAWN UPON A NURSE, 
TOO FAR IN YEARS TO BE A PUPIL NOW. 
WHAT IS THY SENTENCE, THEN, BUT SPEECHLESS DEATH, 
WHICH ROBS MY TONGUE FROM BREATHING NATIVE BREATH?
